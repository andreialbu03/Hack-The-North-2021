# Hack-the-north-2021

This is a project to contribute for Hack The North 2021. 

Intruducing Covi, a covid themed discord bot. A fun and friendly way to learn about covid-19!

## Inspiration

Covid-19 is always in front of our faces. Social distancing, store closures, mask requirements, and so much more have changed the way we go about our lives. Yet we barely comprehend the true scope of what is happening around us. To many, it may appear to just be an abstract and arbitrary set of rules we follow because someone said so.

This mindset isn't something restricted to the crazies which reject compliance. We may believe or assume that what we are doing is necessary, but it doesn't mean that we understand why it is the case. It is a seed of doubt that's been festering in the mind of many.

Is {some policy} actually going to do anything?

How big of a problem is this?

Isn't this possibly excessive?

To resolve this doubt, we must reconcile the abstraction with reality. We have to explain and quantify the situation.

And that is what we will do.


## What it does

Covi's main goal is to educate people regarding covid-19 via the quantification and explanation of the problem at hand. This is accomplished via a variety of bot commands.

Quantification
- Worldwide and national covid statistics
    - Take a look at the cases, deaths, administered tests, and more in any region in the world.
- Worldwide and national covid news
    - Take a look at the trending covid related news in a region or in the world
Explanation
- Competitive covid trivia game
    - Compete with other users to answer as many covid related problems as possible without messing up.
    - Explanations for each question to further your understanding
- Covid tips and tricks
    - A guide to improve your safety and minimize the risk of infection
