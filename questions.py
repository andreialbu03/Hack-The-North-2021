    ["There is more than one coronavirus. A: True / B: False", True,
    "There are hundreds of coronaviruses, and some of them cause disease in humans, such as mild colds and more serious illnesses or death. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, along with those that cause SARS and MERS are examples of coronaviruses that can cause serious illness in people."],
    ["An effective hand sanitizer contains at least this percentage of alcohol to kill the coronavirus and other germs:\n\
    A: 80%\n\

    "The virus that causes Covid-19 is stable for several hours in tiny floating particles, known as aerosols, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, U.S. researchers showed. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March concluded that the novel coronavirus can survive four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard, 48 hours on stainless steel and 72 hours on plastic."],

While you are waiting to be tested, be sure to take appropriate precautions in terms of self-isolating to ensure you don\'t spread it to others if you are positive."],
    ["Smoking can pose specific risks around COVID-19. A: True / B: False", True, 
    "If smokers are in close contact with others, this can increase the risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19.

Experts advise that any steps you can take to protect your respiratory health throughout the pandemic are a good idea."],
    ["Living in a condo increases the risk of COVID-19. A: True / B: False", False, 
    "All the current evidence suggests COVID-19 is not spread through air ducts, so there is no added risk of living in a condo or apartment building in terms of how air is circulated.
